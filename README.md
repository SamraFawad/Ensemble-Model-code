Overview:
This project aims to develop an ensemble model that combines NASNet Mobile and EfficientNet for identifying diseases in the gastrointestinal tract from medical imaging. The ensemble model leverages the strengths of both architectures to improve prediction accuracy. The trained model can be used in medical imaging tools to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing various gastrointestinal diseases.

Key features of the model:
•	NASNet Mobile and EfficientNet are pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on the gastrointestinal dataset.
•	The ensemble model combines the predictions from both models to achieve improved classification performance.
•	The model is trained using a custom dataset of gastrointestinal tract disease images, which includes diseases like Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and gastric cancer.

Installation Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
Python 3.x
pip (Python's package installer)
Dependencies

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt should include the following dependencies:
shell
Copy code
tensorflow>=2.0
keras
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
opencv-python

Dataset:
Ensure you have access to a medical dataset for gastrointestinal tract diseases (Kvasir v1 and v2 uploaded somewhere). This dataset should be structured in folders according to disease categories (e.g., Crohn's disease, Gastric cancer, Healthy).

Usage:
Running the Ensemble Model
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gastrointestinal-disease-ensemble.git
cd gastrointestinal-disease-ensemble

Train the model:

You can train the ensemble model. The training script uses both NASNet Mobile and EfficientNet models for the ensemble approach:

python Ensem.py
This will start the training process, and the model will be compiled alongwith training data. After training, you can evaluate the model by using the same code.

Model Architecture:
The ensemble model combines two architectures:

NASNet Mobile: A lightweight CNN model designed for mobile devices, trained on ImageNet.
EfficientNet: A scalable and efficient CNN architecture that performs well on various computer vision tasks.
Ensemble Method
The predictions from both models are combined using a weighted average method or majority voting (depending on the performance). The final output is determined based on the combined predictions, improving accuracy and robustness.

Training
To train the ensemble model, the following steps are performed:
Load the pre-trained NASNet Mobile and EfficientNet models.
Fine-tune the models using the gastrointestinal disease dataset.
Use transfer learning to adapt the models to the task of classifying gastrointestinal diseases.
Combine the predictions from both models and perform model fusion to improve classification performance.

Training Parameters:
Batch size: 32
Epochs: 20
Learning rate: 0.0001
Loss function: Categorical Crossentropy
Optimizer: Adam
Evaluation
After training the model, evaluate its performance on a separate test set. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the model's performance.
